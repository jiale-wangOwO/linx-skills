# Linx QEMU

## Overview

Use this skill for emulator-focused work in `emulator/qemu` and for runtime failures where QEMU is the likely first divergence point.

## Target lines

Keep the active QEMU line explicit before making changes:

- Current/modern line may expose `linx64-softmmu` in the in-repo build tree.
- For current LinxISA superproject bring-up, prefer
  `/Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/emulator/qemu/build-linx/qemu-system-linx64` when
  it exists. Use `QEMU` or `QEMU_CLEAN_OUT_DIR` only when intentionally testing
  another matching build. The older `emulator/qemu/build/qemu-system-linx64`
  path can be a stale legacy fallback.
- Recovered historical lines can instead expose:
  - `linx-softmmu`
  - `linx-linux-user`
  - `linx_be-linux-user`

Do not assume the target naming surface. Read `configs/targets/` first and use
the names that actually exist in the checked-out branch.

For the merged current recovery lane, direct kernel/rootfs runs are
firmwareless by default. Preserve `-bios none` in local reproductions unless a
specific firmware blob is intentionally under test.

For direct-boot AVS and SuperNPUBench AI workload runs, set
`LINX_VIRT_TEST_FINISHER=1` unless intentionally debugging guest-side spins.
That env makes test finisher MMIO writes report pass/fail to the host instead
of relying on timeout behavior.

The finisher is a post-store MMIO contract. Translation helpers must not stop
the CPU before the terminal store executes and retires: route the write through
the `linx-test-finisher` device, let the normal store/commit path record the
instruction, then use `stop_after_commit` to close commit/Minst traces. Minst
store records must carry the real store value in `mem_wdata`. A focused
regression must end with exactly one retired finisher store at `0x10009000`
with the expected status value; never obtain trace parity by dropping or
normalizing away the terminal record.

QEMU linux-user mode is a separate process ABI lane. Use it only when the
checked-out or recovered QEMU tree actually provides a `qemu-linx` binary; the
current canonical checked-in target list may still expose only softmmu targets.
The reusable smoke form is:

```bash
python3 /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/avs/qemu/run_musl_smoke.py \
  --mode phase-b \
  --link static \
  --runner user \
  --qemu-user /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/emulator/qemu/build-user/qemu-linx
python3 /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/avs/qemu/run_glibc_smoke.py \
  --runner user \
  --qemu-user /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/emulator/qemu/build-user/qemu-linx
```

This invokes `qemu-linx -L <sysroot> <elf>` and should be treated as a fast
pre-rootfs check for ELF startup, libc syscalls, and linux-user dispatch. It
does not replace `qemu-system-linx64` kernel/initramfs or full-OS gates.

## Historical recovery lane

When the user provides a recovered full patch and says it is the authoritative
latest implementation, treat that as a separate recovery workflow rather than a
normal forward-port.

- Prefer finding an old upstream QEMU base that fits the patch over manually
  replaying selected hunks onto a newer branch.
- In this workspace, the recovered `my.patch`-style Linx tree matched best
  against an upstream `v7.0.0` base.
- If you must configure `linx-linux-user` on a non-Linux host during recovery,
  any host-policy relaxations in `configure` / `meson.build` are host bring-up
  adaptations, not ISA or emulator semantic changes.
- If the recovered tree references `pc-bios/LinxInit.bin` but the firmware blob
  is unavailable, prefer making that blob optional for local configure/build
  validation instead of pretending to have reconstructed it.

## Required gates

```bash
bash /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/avs/qemu/check_system_strict.sh
bash /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/avs/qemu/run_tests.sh --all --timeout 10
python3 /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/avs/qemu/run_callret_contract.py
python3 /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/tools/bringup/check_qemu_opcode_meta_sync.py --qemu-root /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/emulator/qemu --allowlist /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/docs/bringup/qemu_opcode_sync_allowlist.json --report-out /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/docs/bringup/gates/qemu_opcode_sync_latest.json --out-md /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/docs/bringup/gates/qemu_opcode_sync_latest.md
python3 /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/tools/bringup/report_qemu_isa_coverage.py --spec /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/isa/v0.57/linxisa-v0.57.json --qemu-meta /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/emulator/qemu/target/linx/linx_opcode_meta_gen.h --report-out /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/docs/bringup/gates/qemu_isa_coverage_latest.json --out-md /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/docs/bringup/gates/qemu_isa_coverage_latest.md
```

Coverage and opcode-sync gates must target the live standalone v0.57 catalog.
Treat any `isa/v0.3`, `isa/v0.4`, or other retired-profile coverage command as
archive-only unless explicitly running a historical comparison.

## Incremental build policy

- Prefer a fresh out-of-tree local build when the checked-in `build/` tree
  drifts across upstream Meson option schema changes.
- Current recovered QEMU uses `configure` passthrough options rather than the
  older `--with-git-submodules=ignore` form. A known-good local rebuild form is:

```bash
mkdir -p /tmp/linx-qemu-local-build
cd /tmp/linx-qemu-local-build
/Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/emulator/qemu/configure \
  --target-list=linx64-softmmu \
  --enable-plugins \
  --disable-docs \
  --disable-werror \
  --disable-install-blobs
ninja qemu-system-linx64
```

- Reuse that build directory for incremental semantic/debug iterations once it
  configures successfully.

## Workflow

1. Reproduce with the smallest AVS case.
2. If the failure is in AVS compile or object generation, first decide whether
   the blocker belongs to the compiler surface rather than QEMU semantics.
   In particular, old Linx AVS cases that still use `%tpcrel_hi/%tpcrel_lo`,
   unfused symbolic `BSTART CALL`, or legacy block-attribute syntax should not
   be treated as emulator regressions until the in-repo `clang` integrated
   assembler accepts them.
3. For Linux userspace/runtime failures, try the linux-user process smoke first
   if `qemu-linx` exists. A user-mode pass narrows later failures to
   kernel/rootfs/system integration; a user-mode fail keeps the first
   divergence in ELF startup, syscall, or linux-user QEMU dispatch.
4. Capture the first wrong architectural event (`pc`, opcode, trap/irq cause, memory side-effect).
5. Only if needed, add targeted QEMU tracing around the suspicious PC or first wrong event; do not start tracing from reset/boot by default.
6. Compare against ISA semantics and expected Linux/runtime behavior.
7. If the first divergence only appears on positive direct-call or call/ret
   runtime cases using 64-bit `L.BSTART.*` headers, verify whether the raw
   immediate decode is still in halfword units before `linx_pcrel_target()`
   shifts it into a byte offset.
8. Patch decode/execute or exception path and add a focused regression.
9. Re-run runtime and system strict gates.

First-divergence rules:

- For current `ET_REL` direct-boot relocation failures, first compare QEMU
  loader relocation types with LLVM `ELFRelocs/LinxISA.def`. Enter opcode
  dispatch only for an explicit whitelist of current relocation types; never
  infer dynamic, TLS, GOT, or unsupported relocations from instruction bits.
- Do not close platform-defined `XB`/`CAC_TABLE` coverage with decoder-only or
  no-op handling. First freeze the table-entry layout plus the `XBINFO`,
  permission, and `E_INST` ABI tracked by `LinxISA/linx-isa#140`.
- Treat `report_qemu_isa_coverage.py` as L1 decoder/source-mapping evidence
  only. Call coverage executable and semantic only when the same form has L2
  runtime execution tied to a test ID and an L3 architectural result oracle;
  report missing L2/L3 evidence as unavailable rather than zero.
- Keep tile hand allocation, source provenance, backing storage, ACR switching,
  and VMState in one state-ownership contract. Shared backing requires shared
  liveness; banked liveness requires equivalently banked backing.
- Interpret B.IOT tile sources as six-bit hand/rank operands, with rank 1 as
  the newest live entry in that hand. Never derive an architectural rank from
  a physical TILE id. Freeze each header's source and output bindings before
  executing its body, reserve outputs in distinct physical slots, then consume
  inputs and publish outputs in descriptor order at successful block commit.
- Stage tile queue metadata locally across TMA, CUBE, and vector execution.
  Backing-memory beats may follow their documented restart rules, but live,
  reserved, ordered, and ACR-pin metadata must become visible atomically. ACR
  source pins and nonempty queue state are migration state: serialize them or
  reject the unsupported migration shape explicitly.
- Normalize typed vector destinations to queue publication rather than direct
  physical replacement. The currently executable LTAR ABI maps TA..TD to
  indices 0..3 and TO/TS to 4/5; do not invent a wider mapping until the
  assembler, compiler, and QEMU parser adopt it together.
- Keep vector LTAR lifetime tied to descriptor provenance. Source-less
  MSEQ/MPAR B.IOT outputs are block-local scratch: reserve them for TO/TS while
  the body runs, then discard them without publishing into a tile hand.
  Input-bound VPAR/TEPL outputs are persistent tile dataflow and must consume
  frozen inputs before publishing the independently reserved output. Until
  general vector lowering becomes queue-relative as one cross-layer change,
  do not apply the tile-body queue-head destination compatibility rule to
  ordinary fixed-slot MSEQ/MPAR code.
- For faultable tile helpers, plan descriptor allocation and source consumption
  without mutating live state, then publish them only after the operation
  succeeds. TMA Normal-memory beats may remain externally non-atomic when the
  ISA allows restartable partial completion, but stale backing is never a
  general substitute for a live source; any compiler-compatibility exception
  must be provenance-bound and operand-exact.
- For v0.57 PTO/tile decode, keep `TPREFETCH` adjacent to the `TLOAD`/`TSTORE`
  encoding family but destination-free. Execute it as a TLOAD-like prefetch of
  addressing and attributes with no tile destination operand and no queue
  publication.
- Decode TMA selectors as the dense v0.57 `0..8` PTO tile-memory family. Reject
  holes, aliases, and legacy selector spellings unless the v0.57 golden manifest
  explicitly reserves them.
- Keep named `CUBE` opcode/template identities unique across QEMU metadata,
  golden decode names, and compiler block templates; never collapse distinct
  CUBE forms into one handler name without an explicit sub-op identity.
- Add scalar CAS/DMA decode metadata and execution coverage as active v0.57
  forms, not compatibility fallbacks.
- When PTOAS/QEMU bridge metadata is involved, validate against the PTO ISA
  0.57.1 map of exactly 120 direct operations (98 TEPL + 9 TMA + 13 CUBE).
  Reject the nine deleted D operations and legacy PTO spellings rather than
  normalizing them silently. TEPL accepts exactly 98 `Mode + Function`
  positions and rejects the other 30 without generic fallback.

For recovered historical lines, insert one extra step before implementation:

1. Pick and validate the old base first.
2. Apply the recovered patch whole if possible.
3. Only then start conflict resolution or branch-local build adaptation.

## Trace policy

- Do not generate full-run QEMU traces from the beginning of execution unless no narrower reproducer exists.
- First localize the suspicious `pc`/opcode/window from AVS output, guest state, or a smaller repro, then enable trace only near that window.
- Keep QEMU trace/log output storage-bounded. Prefer `LINX_*_TRACE_LIMIT`,
  heartbeat/stat counters, and narrow PC/count windows over unbounded logs.
  After a QEMU packet is summarized, preserve the report/manifest and the small
  excerpt cited by docs, then delete bulky rerunnable artifacts such as
  `avs/qemu/out/**/qemu.log`, generated `*.trace`, generated initramfs `*.cpio`,
  and temporary `.omx/tmp*.log` files. Do not keep multi-hundred-MB QEMU logs
  solely as historical context once their outcome is captured in JSON/Markdown.
- For hosted user-fault bring-up, prefer the opt-in `LINX_FAULT_TRACE=1`
  path before adding new trace code. Narrow it with
  `LINX_FAULT_TRACE_PC_LO`/`LINX_FAULT_TRACE_PC_HI` or
  `LINX_FAULT_TRACE_COUNT_LO`/`LINX_FAULT_TRACE_COUNT_HI`, and cap output with
  `LINX_FAULT_TRACE_LIMIT` when possible.
- For wrong runtime instruction bytes, pair a narrow TLB-fill trace with
  PC-watch virtual and physical byte dumps before changing decode. A reusable
  shape is `LINX_TLB_FILL_TRACE_VA=<va>`,
  `LINX_DEBUG_PC_WATCH=<pc>`,
  `LINX_DEBUG_PC_WATCH_DUMP_CODE_BYTES=<n>`, and
  `LINX_DEBUG_PC_WATCH_DUMP_PHYS=1`. If virtual bytes and physical bytes agree
  but disagree with the ELF file offset that should back that VA, treat QEMU as
  following the installed PTE and route the blocker to Linux file
  mapping/page-cache/VMA triage.
- For SPEC userspace-trap PC-watch packets, require the runner's
  `qemu_debug_env` JSON field in the evidence so the exact heartbeat,
  fault-trace, and PC-watch knobs are reproducible. Keep watch sets minimal:
  broad multi-window PC-watch can perturb row timing enough to change a
  userspace trap into a kernel live-timeout. `LINX_DEBUG_PC_WATCH_RING=1` is
  useful when the terminal fault is on a watched PC, but signal paths can still
  end without `LINX_PC_WATCH_RING` output; in that case use printed
  `linx_pc_watch:` / `LINX_PC_WATCH_REGS` hit lines as authoritative evidence
  and narrow the next repro toward the producer/caller path instead of widening
  the trace.
- For SPEC live-timeout throughput triage, use the SPEC runner switch
  `--qemu-tlb-stats` or `LINX_SPEC_QEMU_TLB_STATS=1` before enabling full
  `LINX_TLB_TRACE=1`. The switch sets `LINX_QEMU_TLB_STATS=1`; QEMU appends
  `tlbi_iall`, `tlbi_ia`, `tlbi_iv`, `tlbi_iav`, and last-invalidation
  PC/BPC/operand/ACR fields to `LINX_HEARTBEAT` without enabling the
  experimental MMU cache. The SPEC runner records these fields under
  `heartbeat_tlb_invalidation` and prints compact `tlbi=` liveness tags. Use
  this to separate startup/fault-path invalidation pressure from steady-state
  benchmark execution before changing QEMU TLB behavior.
- For SPEC demand page-walk attribution, use `LINX_QEMU_TLB_FILL_STATS=1`
  before enabling full `LINX_QEMU_TLB_FILL_TRACE=1`. The fill-stats path adds
  `tlbf_total`, fetch/load/store/probe/ok/fault counts, user/kernel/other
  MMU-index splits, and last-fill PC/BPC/VA/PA/access/MMU/prot/cause/ACR
  fields to `LINX_HEARTBEAT`; the SPEC runner records them under
  `heartbeat_tlb_fill` and prints compact `tlbf=` liveness tags in matrix
  markdown. Use full fill traces only after the aggregate counters identify a
  row/window worth narrowing.
- For SPEC page-walk cache experiments, do not treat QEMU's `tlb_set_page`
  `size` argument as multi-page lookup coverage. Upstream cputlb still
  materializes one `TARGET_PAGE_SIZE` entry and uses larger sizes only for
  invalidation bookkeeping. If Linx large block mappings are the target, keep
  the generic soft-TLB page-granular and test the opt-in block-aware page-walk
  result cache via the SPEC runner switches `--qemu-mmu-cache` and
  `--qemu-mmu-cache-stats` (or their `LINX_QEMU_MMU_CACHE=1` /
  `LINX_QEMU_MMU_CACHE_STATS=1` env equivalents); use the runner's
  `heartbeat_mmu_cache` / `mmuc=` fields to prove hit/miss/fill behavior before
  promoting it. On 2026-07-05, focused `505.mcf_r` train improved from
  `41000000005` to `45000000003` bounded instructions in 180s with
  `mmuc_hit=122234545`, while strict `999.specrand_ir` passed with the new
  switches; keep the cache opt-in until all-row train evidence is green.
  The 2026-07-06 clean train-all packet
  `workloads/generated/specint-train-all-mmuc-split-clean-qemu-20260706-r1/`
  adds size-class and collision counters. Read `mmuc_col*` before changing the
  cache shape: high 4K collision ratios, as in `505.mcf_r` and
  `531.deepsjeng_r`, justify associativity or user-data fast-path prototypes;
  low hit and low collision rows, as in `541.leela_r` and `525.x264_r`, should
  stay in TB/template or transport lanes instead of MMU-cache resizing.
  The 2026-07-06 same-head assoc2 controls reject the first adjacent 2-way
  cache-shape prototype as a promotion candidate:
  `workloads/generated/specint-505-mmuc-direct-control-qemu-20260706-r1/`
  versus `workloads/generated/specint-505-mmuc-assoc2-qemu-20260706-r1/`
  drops `505.mcf_r` hits and raises fills/collisions, and
  `workloads/generated/specint-531-mmuc-direct-control-qemu-20260706-r1/`
  versus `workloads/generated/specint-531-mmuc-assoc2-qemu-20260706-r1/`
  drops `531.deepsjeng_r` hits while leaving fills/collisions flat. Keep
  `LINX_QEMU_MMU_CACHE_ASSOC2` / `--qemu-mmu-cache-assoc2` default-off and do
  not put it into all-row train gates unless a new same-head control beats the
  direct-mapped cache. Future cache-shape experiments should avoid simply
  pairing adjacent direct-map slots; preserve or improve direct-map locality
  first, then rerun `999.specrand_ir` plus focused `505`/`531` controls before
  train-all promotion.
- For long live-timeout rows where aggregate fill volume is high but full fill
  trace output would be too large, add `LINX_QEMU_TLB_FILL_HOT=1` alongside
  `LINX_QEMU_TLB_FILL_STATS=1`. QEMU emits `LINX_TLB_FILL_HOT` heartbeat
  companion lines with a small hot-page sketch; the SPEC runner records
  `heartbeat_tlb_fill_hot` and prints compact `tlbf-hot=` tags with the
  hottest page/access/MMU tuple, eviction pressure, and reuse/churn counters
  (`inserts`, `last_hits`, `slot_hits`). If `inserts` and `evictions` track
  total fills while `last_hits`/`slot_hits` stay near zero, route the row to
  streaming page-walk or soft-MMU lookup cost rather than enlarging the small
  hot-page sketch. The 2026-07-06 focused `505.mcf_r` train packet
  `workloads/generated/specint-505-tlbf-hot-reuse-qemu-20260706-r1/` is the
  current example: `tlbf_total=89914727`, `inserts=89914720`,
  `evictions=89914704`, `last_hits=5`, and `slot_hits=2`.
  The 2026-07-06 focused `505.mcf_r` post-start host profile
  `workloads/generated/specint-505-poststart-profile-speedstack-qemu-20260706-r1/`
  showed `linx_tlb_fill_stats_record` in the top QEMU frames, but a same-head
  75-second A/B rejected TLB-fill stats/hot instrumentation as the row-level
  throughput limiter: `workloads/generated/specint-505-speedstack-tlbfillstats-control-qemu-20260706-r1/`
  and `workloads/generated/specint-505-speedstack-no-tlbfillstats-qemu-20260706-r1/`
  both reached 21B bounded instructions with effectively identical TB,
  MMU-cache, TLBI, and frame counters. Do not spend a speed loop optimizing
  TLB-fill stats overhead for 505 unless a new matched control shows a real
  instruction-count delta; keep the next 505 work on frame helper exits,
  generic soft-MMU lookup/probe cost, TB dispatch, and page-walk cache shape.
- For SPEC rows or post-start profiles where `helper_linx_tlb_iv` is hot, add
  `LINX_QEMU_TLB_INV_HOT=1` or the SPEC runner switch `--qemu-tlb-inv-hot`
  alongside `--qemu-tlb-stats` before changing QEMU cputlb behavior. QEMU emits
  `LINX_TLB_INV_HOT` heartbeat companion lines keyed by invalidation op and
  source PC, with last BPC/operand/page/ACR plus per-heartbeat deltas. The SPEC
  runner records `heartbeat_tlb_inv_hot` and prints compact `tlbi-hot=` tags.
  If the hot source is in Linx Linux `update_mmu_cache_range()` or
  `ptep_set_wrprotect()`, route the next speed loop to Linux flush frequency or
  batching before retrying QEMU MMU-index narrowing.
- For SPEC frame-template attribution, use `LINX_QEMU_FRAME_STATS=1` or the
  SPEC runner's `--qemu-frame-stats` before enabling full `LINX_FENTRY_TRACE`
  / `LINX_FRET_STK_TRACE`. QEMU appends `fr_` counters to `LINX_HEARTBEAT`,
  and the SPEC runner records them under `heartbeat_frame_stats`. Use this to
  rule frame fallback stores or return-cache misses in/out before reopening
  frame-store, restore-load, or BSTART return-target experiments.
- When aggregate `fr_` counters show frame-template traffic but do not identify
  the hot shape, add `LINX_QEMU_FRAME_SHAPE_HOT=1` or the SPEC runner switch
  `--qemu-frame-shape-hot`. QEMU emits `LINX_FRAME_SHAPE_HOT` companion lines
  with the hottest frame kind, register range, register count, stack size,
  count/delta, and eviction pressure; the SPEC runners record
  `heartbeat_frame_shape_hot` and matrix markdown prints `frame-hot=` tags. On
  2026-07-05, focused `541.leela_r` train showed the dominant shape was a
  one-register stack-32 `FENTRY`/`FRET.STK` pair, so future template-helper
  speed prototypes should specialize concrete shapes like that before adding
  broader frame-helper machinery.
- For one-register frame-template speed experiments, use
  `LINX_QEMU_FRAME_SINGLE_REG_FAST=1` or the SPEC runner switch
  `--qemu-frame-single-reg-fast`. The path is default-off, applies only to
  valid one-register `FENTRY`/`FRET.STK` shapes, and keeps frame trace modes on
  the generic implementation. Pair it with `--qemu-frame-stats` so
  `fr_single_fast_fentry` and `fr_single_fast_fret_stk` prove usage. On
  2026-07-05, focused `541.leela_r` train improved from `5500000007` to
  `5900000001` bounded instructions in the fine-heartbeat 45s shape while
  strict `999.specrand_ir` and call/ret contract gates passed. The same day,
  clean-build train-all evidence under
  `workloads/generated/specint-train-all-frame-single-fast-clean-qemu-20260705-r1/`
  kept `999.specrand_ir` passing and all other rows live-progressing, but the
  timeout-normalized result was mixed: `520`, `523`, `525`, and `541` improved,
  `531` was roughly flat, and `500`, `505`, and `557` regressed versus the
  prior clean ledger. Keep it opt-in/default-off and use it only for focused
  one-register frame-shape experiments when used by itself. A later same-head
  180-second train-all run that stacked `--qemu-frame-single-reg-fast` on top
  of `--qemu-mmu-cache --qemu-mmu-cache-stats` improved six measured rows
  versus MMU-cache-only (`500`, `502`, `505`, `525`, `541`, and `557`) and left
  `520`, `523`, and `531` flat while preserving the strict
  `999.specrand_ir` train hash
  (`workloads/generated/specint-train-all-mmuc-single-fast-latest-qemu-20260705-r1/`).
  Treat that combined stack as the current best bounded all-row speed probe,
  but keep it opt-in/default-off until at least one real SPEC row completes
  with correct output. Feature-compatible post-start profiles for that stack
  under
  `workloads/generated/specint-profile-suite-train-mmuc-single-fast-latest-qemu-20260705-r1/`
  split the next speed lanes into template/TB/MMU dispatch for `500`, `502`,
  `505`, `520`, `523`, and `541`; Linux TLBI source reduction for `531` and
  `557`; and separate 9p/kernel transport profiling for `525`.
- Never promote `--qemu-speed-stack` without a same-manifest, default-off
  `999.specrand_ir` train A/B first. On 2026-07-17 the default-off sentinel
  completed with its strict hash in 108.581 seconds, while the speed-stack
  lane timed out at 180 seconds; the same speed-stack run timed out all ten
  train rows before hash checking. For timeout diagnosis, also set a nonzero
  `--qemu-heartbeat-interval`: enabling extended heartbeat fields alone does
  not emit `LINX_HEARTBEAT`, so `running` and site-progress remain
  unobservable and must not be reported as proof of either liveness or stall.
- For SPEC frame restore-load experiments, keep
  `LINX_QEMU_FRAME_RESTORE_HOST_LOAD=1` / `LINX_FRAME_RESTORE_HOST_LOAD=1`
  opt-in and normally drive it through the SPEC runner's
  `--qemu-frame-restore-host-load` or
  `LINX_SPEC_QEMU_FRAME_RESTORE_HOST_LOAD=1`. The fast path uses a
  same-page, non-faulting host-pointer hit probe for restore slots and falls
  back to the existing faulting load on misses. Use it only with
  `--qemu-frame-stats` so `fr_restore_host` and `fr_restore_fallback` prove
  whether the run actually used the path. As of 2026-07-04 it improved a
  focused `531.deepsjeng_r` train sample but did not close the all-row train
  gate and does not replace the data-memory/TLB lane for `505`. The 2026-07-06
  same-head train-all comparison on QEMU head
  `4e9c0fcf35e80216ae46e407d97118ecd721618a` rejected broad promotion:
  `--qemu-frame-restore-host-load` preserved the strict `999.specrand_ir`
  sentinel and improved bounded counts for `502.gcc_r`, `525.x264_r`, and
  `557.xz_r`, but regressed `500.perlbench_r`, `505.mcf_r`,
  `520.omnetpp_r`, `523.xalancbmk_r`, and `531.deepsjeng_r`, with `541.leela_r`
  neutral. Keep it default-off for all-row gates; use it as a focused A/B
  switch on rows where restore-side frame traffic is the current hypothesis.
- For SPEC frame-template dispatch experiments, keep
  `LINX_QEMU_TEMPLATE_CHAIN=1` opt-in until real SPEC rows complete correctly
  under the speed stack. The 2026-07-04 focused `523.xalancbmk_r` probe with
  `LINX_QEMU_MMU_CACHE=1` improved the 120-second count from 16B to 22B
  instructions while preserving call/ret and 999 sentinels. The later
  same-head 180-second train-all run stacked template chaining on
  `--qemu-mmu-cache`, `--qemu-mmu-cache-stats`,
  `--qemu-frame-single-reg-fast`, and `--qemu-frame-stats`, preserved the
  strict `999.specrand_ir` train hash, and
  improved all nine measured train rows versus the same stack without template
  chaining: `500` +18.00%, `502` +64.29%, `505` +27.08%, `520` +83.33%,
  `523` +69.57%, `525` +96.43%, `531` +31.25%, `541` +80.95%, and
  `557` +72.50%
  (`workloads/generated/specint-train-all-mmuc-single-fast-template-chain-latest-qemu-20260705-r1/`).
  Drive new fast-gate runs with `--template-chain` instead of relying only on
  ambient env; the comparison/analyzer tools also infer older env-only runs
  from linked stage-row `qemu_debug_env`. Treat this full stack as the current
  best bounded all-row speed probe, but keep it default-off until at least one
  real SPEC row completes with correct output. A feature-compatible post-start
  profile for that full stack exists under
  `workloads/generated/specint-profile-suite-train-mmuc-single-fast-template-chain-latest-qemu-20260705-r1/`
  with the joined lane report under
  `workloads/generated/specint-qemu-progress-analysis-mmuc-single-fast-template-chain-latest-20260705-r1/`.
  Do not repeat that profile before the next implementation change. The lane
  split is still template/TB/MMU dispatch for `500`, `502`, `505`, `520`,
  `523`, and `541`; Linux TLBI attribution for `531` and `557`; and a separate
  9p row for `525`, whose latest active frames are also template/TB/MMU-heavy.
  The next QEMU speed loop should target template return/entry helper exits,
  TB lookup/dispatch, and soft-MMU lookup/probe for the six shared rows first,
  then rerun the all-row gate with `999.specrand_ir` as the strict sentinel.
- For SPEC TCG dispatch/cache-pressure attribution, use
  `LINX_QEMU_TB_STATS=1` or the SPEC runner's `--qemu-tb-stats` before changing
  TCG `tb-size`, cache policy, or dispatch behavior. QEMU appends `tbs_`
  counters to `LINX_HEARTBEAT`, and the SPEC runner records them under
  `heartbeat_tb_stats`. Use this after host profiles implicate
  `cpu_tb_exec`, `pthread_jit_write_protect_np`, or TB lookup/codegen pressure.
  When aggregate counters show high lookup/dispatch pressure but do not identify
  a source PC, add `LINX_QEMU_TB_HOT=1` or the SPEC runner switch
  `--qemu-tb-hot` on a focused row. QEMU emits `LINX_TB_HOT` companion lines
  with a 256-slot hot-PC sketch; the SPEC runners record
  `heartbeat_tb_hot` and matrix markdown prints compact `tb-hot=` tags with
  lookup delta, total lookup count, jump-cache hits, hash hits, misses, and
  eviction pressure. On 2026-07-06, focused `502.gcc_r` train evidence in
  `workloads/generated/specint-502-tb-hot-256-qemu-20260706-r1/` identified
  `0xffffffff8006dbca` as the all-run max-delta TB lookup PC
  (`125865/125865`, all jump-cache hits) while the row stayed heartbeat-live.
  That PC appeared before `LINX_SPEC_START` and resolves to
  `printk_ringbuffer.c`; quiet/loglevel bootargs were neutral. When
  `LINX_SPEC_START` is present, prefer `heartbeat_tb_hot.post_start_*` fields
  or matrix `tb-hot=post:` markdown for benchmark-phase attribution. Symbolize
  post-start user PCs against the matching benchmark ELF before changing QEMU
  cache policy; current runner output records this under
  `heartbeat_tb_hot_user_symbols` / `heartbeat_tb_hot_user_symbol_evidence`
  for no-ASLR Linx static-PIE rows. The same 502 evidence maps the benchmark
  hot PC to `0x403ec3aa=gimple_code gimple.c:0`, with nearby `gimplify.c` and
  `tree-inline.c` blocks, so route 502-style evidence to user tiny-helper
  dispatch/template-entry-return/TB chaining work. Route all-run boot-phase
  kernel PCs through the Linux TLBI/timer/transport lane first.
  The 2026-07-03 focused `505.mcf_r` probe had `tbs_flush=0`, stable
  miss/generation counts, and only about 36 MiB of roughly 1 GiB code-buffer
  use, so larger TB cache was rejected; route similar evidence toward per-TB
  dispatch/JIT transition and soft-MMU lookup work instead. A simple
  per-thread TLS guard around `qemu_thread_jit_execute()` /
  `qemu_thread_jit_write()` was also rejected on 2026-07-03: it preserved 999
  correctness but lowered the comparable no-stats 505 count to about 30B
  instructions in 120s, below the clean 34B baseline.
- If a post-`LINX_SPEC_START` SPEC profile shows `helper_linx_tlb_iv` hot,
  first quantify Linux-side `local_flush_tlb_page()` sources before changing
  QEMU cputlb semantics. In the 2026-07-04 `531.deepsjeng_r` profile,
  `helper_linx_tlb_iv` was the second largest active QEMU frame after
  `probe_access_internal`; a naive uncommitted experiment that narrowed
  `TLB.IV`/`TLB.IAV` to an address-derived QEMU MMU-index map preserved the
  999 sentinel but was neutral on focused 531. Do not retry address-derived
  MMU-index narrowing without new evidence; inspect Linx Linux
  `update_mmu_cache_range`, `ptep_set_wrprotect`, and fault/vmalloc
  `local_flush_tlb_page()` call volume first.
- For host-side SPEC profiling, prefer
  `tools/spec2017/profile_qemu_after_spec_start.py` over manual `pgrep` or
  parent-process sampling. The wrapper waits for `LINX_SPEC_START` in the
  generated `qemu.log`, then samples only a descendant whose executable
  basename is `qemu-system-linx64`, avoiding false samples of Python runner
  commands that merely contain a `--qemu` argument.
- Keep trace scope minimal: shortest repro, narrowest event set, shortest instruction window, and one lane at a time.
- Treat QEMU traces as disposable debugging artifacts. Remove large trace/log outputs immediately after extracting the needed evidence.
- Clean temporary QEMU traces from `/tmp`, `/private/tmp`, and repo-local output trees before closeout when they are no longer needed.

## Collaboration rules

- When QEMU diverges from LinxCore/pyCircuit traces, act as reference owner and publish first mismatch evidence.
- Keep timer IRQ policy explicit in strict runs (`LINX_EMU_DISABLE_TIMER_IRQ=0` by default).
- Coordinate trap/MMU semantic updates with `linx-isa` before declaring closure.
- If a QEMU AVS case is blocked by current compiler asm-surface compatibility
  rather than emulator semantics, mark or skip that case explicitly in the AVS
  harness instead of counting it as a QEMU execution failure.

## Reusable QEMU pitfalls

- Do not trust an incremental build that runs only the generated
  `qemu-version.h` rule. In the affected build tree that rule could be dirty
  and return success before compiling changed Linx objects. Check that the
  changed object and final `qemu-system-linx64` were rebuilt; if not, clean only
  reproducible files from the QEMU build directory with the build tool and
  rebuild. Never clean the source checkout or use a broad recursive deletion.
- Keep the QEMU executable, tile-state encoder, and gfrun snapshot writer on
  the same resolved ISA release identity. A snapshot `ISA commit mismatch` is
  a harness/provenance failure even when both programs exit with code zero;
  update the two encoders together and rerun tile-state cases.
- Run source-level QEMU tests from the QEMU checkout. When `pytest` is absent,
  use the repository's `unittest` entry points directly; an import failure from
  a wrong working directory is not a QEMU semantic failure.
- A current-ASL-invalid carrier that hangs in a cooperative rendezvous is not
  a useful positive regression. First classify it as retired or negative
  coverage. For a retained negative test, prove fail-closed behavior and
  termination separately; do not weaken the legality gate or extend the
  timeout until it appears to pass.
- Keep compatibility exceptions narrow and named. When a release intentionally
  keeps an old carrier warning-only, preserve the explicit legacy predicate and
  its source-level regression assertion while keeping the current contract path
  separate. Do not replace it with a broad shape or capacity relaxation.
- Source contract tests may check a semantic invariant through a branch name or
  marker. Before deleting such a branch during a refactor, inspect the test and
  the old implementation; preserve the invariant or update the test to the
  actual architecture rule in the same reviewable change.

## Skill evolve loop (mandatory closeout)

- At closeout, decide `skill-evolve: update` or `skill-evolve: no-update`.
- Update this skill only for material reusable findings:
  - new emulator semantic rule that must stay aligned with LinxArch,
  - new required runtime gate/command/env for reproducibility,
  - new recurring first-divergence triage sequence.
- Do not update for minor optimization, wording cleanup, or one-off local workaround.
- If update is needed, keep scope narrow and validate with:
  - `python3 /Users/zhoubot/.codex/skills/.system/skill-creator/scripts/quick_validate.py /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/skills/linx-skills/linx-qemu`
  - `python3 /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/skills/linx-skills/scripts/check_skill_change_scope.py --repo-root /Users/zhoubot/linx-isa/skills/linx-skills --base origin/main`
